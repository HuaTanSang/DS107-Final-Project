# DS107 - Computational Thinking Final Project  
In this project, our team going to build a source code base on a paper named 'Differentially Private Simple Linear Regression'.  
A demo is shown in the demo.py, for hardware limitation we going to build a prediction on a generated dataset decribed in demo.py.
